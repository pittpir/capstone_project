# Capstone Project Idea

### Option 1 - Watered down Reddit Blog Site

The concept is to select one of 3 topics (sports, weather, politics) and allow users to to submit a heading for discussion and responses.  User will need to log in and may contain these features per user (avatar, posts, responses, likes).  Also add an admin to manage submissions that need some fine tuning.  

Technologies: React Front End, NodeJS for RESTful API, both a RDBS and a  NonRBDS.  

 
### Option 2 - Movie Theater Web Page

User would go to the site to checkout movie times, select tickets and then obtain the tickets.  A supervisor mode would allow the supervisor to enter in showtimes per location.
